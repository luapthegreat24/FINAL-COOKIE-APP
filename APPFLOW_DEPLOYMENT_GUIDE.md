## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Fails:

- Check that all dependencies are in package.json
- Ensure capacitor.config.ts has correct Bundle ID
- Verify certificates are not expired

### Certificate Issues:

- Use Appflow's automatic certificate generation
- Make sure Bundle ID matches everywhere
- Check that provisioning profiles match certificates

### App Won't Install on Device:

- Ensure device UDID is in provisioning profile (for Development builds)
- Use App Store build for TestFlight (doesn't need UDID)

---

## Updating Your App

1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push to GitHub (using GitHub Desktop)
3. In Appflow, trigger a new build with the latest commit
4. Deploy to TestFlight
