                <p className="story-text">
                  It all started in 2024 when our founder, a passionate baker
                  with a dream, began experimenting with cookie recipes in a
                  tiny apartment kitchen. What started as a weekend hobby
                  quickly turned into an obsession. Friends and family couldn't
                  get enough of those warm, gooey, chocolatey delights!
                </p>
                <p className="story-text">
                  Word spread fast (faster than cookie crumbs on a couch), and
                  soon we were taking orders from neighbors, then friends of
                  neighbors, and before we knew it, the whole community was
                  asking for more. That's when we realized - we had something
                  special on our hands.

                <p className="story-text">
                  At Chip Happens, we believe that cookies are more than just
                  desserts - they're little moments of happiness wrapped in
                  dough. Our mission is simple: to bring joy to every bite and
                  smiles to every face.
                </p>
                <p className="story-text">
                  We're committed to using only the finest ingredients, baking
                  with love, and creating cookies that remind you of home,
                  childhood, and all the good things in life. Because when life
                  gets tough, sometimes you just need a really good cookie.
